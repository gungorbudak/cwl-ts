/**
 *
 * When listed under `inputBinding` in the input schema, the term
 * "value" refers to the the corresponding value in the input object.  For
 * binding objects listed in `CommandLineTool.arguments`, the term "value"
 * refers to the effective value after evaluating `valueFrom`.
 *
 * The binding behavior when building the command line depends on the data
 * type of the value.  If there is a mismatch between the type described by
 * the input schema and the effective value, such as resulting from an
 * expression evaluation, an implementation must use the data type of the
 * effective value.
 *
 *   - **string**: Add `prefix` and the string to the command line.
 *
 *   - **number**: Add `prefix` and decimal representation to command line.
 *
 *   - **boolean**: If true, add `prefix` to the command line.  If false, add
 *       nothing.
 *
 *   - **File**: Add `prefix` and the value of
 *     [`File.path`](#File) to the command line.
 *
 *   - **array**: If `itemSeparator` is specified, add `prefix` and the join
 *       the array into a single string with `itemSeparator` separating the
 *       items.  Otherwise first add `prefix`, then recursively process
 *       individual elements.
 *
 *   - **object**: Add `prefix` only, and recursively add object fields for
 *       which `inputBinding` is specified.
 *
 *   - **null**: Add nothing.
